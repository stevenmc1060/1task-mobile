## üöÄ Alternative: Continue with Mock Authentication

If you want to continue development while fixing the MSAL issue, I can temporarily update the authentication service to use mock authentication so you can test the rest of the app.

Let me know if you'd like me to create a mock version for now!

## üì± Verify Installation Steps

Make sure you followed these steps when adding MSAL:

1. **File** ‚Üí **Add Package Dependencies**
2. Enter URL: `https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-objc`
3. Click **Add Package**
4. Select **MSAL** library

6. Make sure it's added to your app target (not just the project)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

- **Wrong URL**: Make sure you used the correct GitHub URL
- **Target Selection**: Package must be added to your app target, not just the project
- **Xcode Cache**: Sometimes Xcode's package cache gets corrupted
- **Xcode Version**: Make sure you're using a recent version of Xcode

Try these solutions in order, and let me know which one fixes the issue!
