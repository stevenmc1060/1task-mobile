# MSAL Import Fix - Real-time Status

## Current Error
```
/Users/stevemcpherson/1TaskAssistant Root/1task-mobile/iOS/1task-mobile/1task-mobile/MSALAuthenticationService.swift:4:8 No such module 'MSAL'
```

## Package Status ✅
- MSAL package is installed: `microsoft-authentication-library-for-objc @ 2.3.0`
- Package.resolved confirms it's properly downloaded

## Possible Import Names to Try

The MSAL package might use a different module name. Try these imports in order:

### Option 1: Standard Import (currently trying)
```swift
import MSAL
```

### Option 2: iOS-specific Import
```swift
import MSAL_iOS
```

### Option 3: Specific Product Import
```swift
import MSALiOS
```

### Option 4: Full Product Name
```swift
import MicrosoftAuthenticationLibrary
```

## Xcode Fixes to Try Right Now

### 1. Check Build Phases (MOST LIKELY FIX)
1. Select your project in Xcode navigator
2. Select your **1task-mobile** target
3. Go to **Build Phases** tab
4. Expand **Link Binary With Libraries**
5. Look for MSAL library - it should be there
6. If missing, click **+** and add **MSAL** from the list

### 2. Check Package Dependencies Tab
1. Select your **project** (not target) in navigator
2. Go to **Package Dependencies** tab
3. Make sure the MSAL package shows your target in the "Add to Target" column
4. If it doesn't, click the checkbox next to your app target

### 3. Product Name Check
1. In Package Dependencies tab, click on the MSAL package
2. Look at what products are available (might be "MSAL", "MSALiOS", etc.)
3. Make sure the correct product is selected for your target

### 4. Clean and Reset (if still failing)
```
1. Product → Clean Build Folder (⇧⌘K)
2. File → Packages → Reset Package Caches
3. Close Xcode completely
4. Reopen project
5. Build again
```

## Next Steps
1. Try the Build Phases check first (most common cause)
2. Let me know which product names you see in the Package Dependencies
3. If none work, I can help debug further

The package is definitely installed, so this is just a linking/targeting issue in Xcode.
