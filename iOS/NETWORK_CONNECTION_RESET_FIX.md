# 🚨 Network Connection Reset Error - Advanced Troubleshooting

## 🔍 Root Cause Identified

**Network Logs Show:**
```
Socket SO_ERROR [54: Connection reset by peer]
nw_read_request_report [C1] Receive failed with error "Connection reset by peer"
```

**This means:**
- Your device successfully connects to Microsoft's servers
- The server **actively terminates** the connection during token exchange
- This is typically caused by **network infrastructure** blocking the request

## 🌐 Common Causes & Solutions

### 1. **Corporate/School Network Restrictions**
**Most Likely Cause** - Corporate firewalls often block OAuth token exchanges

**Solution:**
- **Switch to cellular data** (turn off Wi-Fi completely)
- Try authentication on cellular network
- If it works → corporate firewall is the issue

### 2. **VPN or Proxy Interference**
**Check if you have:**
- VPN enabled (Disconnect and try)
- Corporate proxy settings
- Content filtering software

### 3. **DNS Resolution Issues**
**Test in Safari:**
- Go to `https://login.microsoftonline.com`
- Go to `https://graph.microsoft.com`
- If these don't load → DNS/network configuration issue

### 4. **iOS Simulator Network Limitations**
**If using iOS Simulator:**
- **Try on a physical iPhone/iPad device**
- Simulators have more restrictive network policies
- Real devices often work when simulators fail

## 🔧 Technical Fixes Applied

I've added **network diagnostics** to your app:

### **Network Connectivity Test**
- Tests Microsoft endpoints before authentication
- Shows which specific URLs are blocked
- Helps identify the exact network issue

### **Enhanced Error Logging**
- More detailed connection failure information
- Helps identify if it's DNS, firewall, or proxy

## 🧪 Testing Steps

1. **Build and run** the updated app
2. **Tap "Sign In"** - you'll see network diagnostics in console
3. **Check debug output** for:
   ```
   🌐 Testing network connectivity to Microsoft endpoints...
   ✅ Successfully reached https://login.microsoftonline.com/...
   ❌ Failed to reach https://graph.microsoft.com/...
   ```

## 🎯 Quick Resolution Tests

### **Test A: Cellular Data**
1. **Turn off Wi-Fi** completely
2. **Use cellular data only**  
3. **Try authentication**
4. **If successful** → Corporate/Wi-Fi network blocking

### **Test B: Different Location**
1. **Try from home network** (not office/school)
2. **Try from different Wi-Fi network**
3. **If successful** → Original network has restrictions

### **Test C: Physical Device**
1. **If using simulator** → Try on real iPhone
2. **Deploy to physical device**
3. **Test authentication**

## 💡 Temporary Workaround

While fixing network issues, you can:
1. **Use "Continue as Demo User"** button
2. **Test the rest of the app functionality**
3. **Return to authentication testing later**

## 🔧 Network Administrator Solutions

**If on corporate network, IT may need to whitelist:**
- `*.login.microsoftonline.com`
- `*.graph.microsoft.com`  
- `*.msauth.net`
- Allow OAuth 2.0 token exchange endpoints

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Try cellular data test first** (most likely to work)
2. **Check debug console** for specific blocked endpoints
3. **If cellular works** → Contact IT about network restrictions
4. **If nothing works** → Try on different device/network

The connection reset error indicates the network infrastructure is actively blocking Microsoft OAuth traffic. Cellular data is your best bet for immediate testing! 📱🚀
