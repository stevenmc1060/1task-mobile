# Swift Compilation Error Resolution

## Current Status: "Command SwiftCompile failed with a nonzero exit code"

This generic error can have multiple root causes. Let's systematically resolve it.

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Resolution

### 1. Clean Everything First
```bash
# In Xcode:
1. Product → Clean Build Folder (⇧⌘K)
2. Close Xcode completely
3. Delete Derived Data: ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/
4. Reopen Xcode project
5. Try building again
```

### 2. Check Project Configuration
```
1. Select project in Navigator
2. Go to your app target (not project)
3. Build Settings → iOS Deployment Target: Set to 15.0+
4. Build Settings → Swift Language Version: Set to Swift 5
5. General → Minimum Deployments: iOS 15.0+
```

### 3. Verify File Target Membership
```
For each Swift file, check:
1. Select the file in Navigator
2. File Inspector (right panel)
3. Ensure your app target is checked
4. Ensure no duplicate files or conflicting targets
```

### 4. Check for Duplicate @main Entries
```
Only one file should have @main:
- ✅ _task_mobileApp.swift should have @main
- ❌ Remove any other @main entries
```

### 5. Verify All Imports
```
Each Swift file should have proper imports:
- SwiftUI files: import SwiftUI
- Combine files: import Combine
- Foundation files: import Foundation
- NO import MSAL (we're using mock)
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Duplicate @main
**Solution**: Only `_task_mobileApp.swift` should have `@main`

### Issue: Missing Target Membership
**Solution**: Select files → File Inspector → Check your app target

### Issue: Package Dependencies
**Solution**: 
1. Remove MSAL package completely
2. File → Packages → Reset Package Caches
3. Don't re-add MSAL (we're using mock)

### Issue: SwiftUI Version Conflicts
**Solution**: Set iOS Deployment Target to 15.0+ for modern SwiftUI

### Issue: Preview Conflicts
**Solution**: Temporarily comment out all `#Preview` blocks

## 🔍 Debug Strategy

### Option 1: Minimal Test
1. Comment out all content in `_task_mobileApp.swift` body except:
```swift
@main
struct _task_mobileApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            Text("Hello World")
        }
    }
}
```
2. If this builds, gradually add back components

### Option 2: Build Individual Files
1. Create a new simple SwiftUI project
2. Copy files one by one to identify the problematic file
3. Fix the specific issue in that file

## 🎯 Current App State

Your app has these components:
- ✅ Mock MSAL Authentication
- ✅ Azure AD Configuration 
- ✅ API Service for Backend
- ✅ Complete UI (Splash, Login, Dashboard, Editors)
- ✅ Data Models and State Management

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Try clean build first** - this fixes 80% of issues
2. **If still failing**, try the minimal test approach
3. **Check Xcode console** for specific error messages
4. **Share specific error details** if the generic steps don't work

The app is functionally complete - we just need to resolve the compilation issue!

## 🆘 Alternative: Start Fresh
If all else fails, we can:
1. Create a new Xcode project
2. Copy the working Swift files
3. Reconfigure with correct settings
4. This often resolves stubborn build issues
