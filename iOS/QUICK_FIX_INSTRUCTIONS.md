# Quick Fix for MSAL Import Issue

## ðŸš¨ Current Problem
The MSAL package import is failing with "No such module 'MSAL'" even though you've added the package.

## âš¡ Immediate Solution

**Option 1: Use Mock Version (Recommended for now)**
1. In Xcode, rename `MSALAuthenticationService.swift` to `MSALAuthenticationService_REAL.swift`
2. Rename `MSALAuthenticationService_TEMP.swift` to `MSALAuthenticationService.swift`
3. Build and run - the app will work with mock authentication

**Option 2: Fix the Import Issue**
Follow the steps in `MSAL_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`:
1. Clean Build Folder (â‡§âŒ˜K)
2. Restart Xcode
3. Check Package Dependencies are properly linked
4. Try removing and re-adding the MSAL package

## ðŸ§ª With Mock Version You Can Test:
- âœ… Login/logout flow in the app
- âœ… Dashboard and all views
- âœ… API integration (with mock tokens)
- âœ… Data persistence and sync
- âœ… All app navigation and UI

## ðŸ”„ To Switch Back to Real MSAL:
Once MSAL import is fixed:
1. Rename `MSALAuthenticationService.swift` back to `MSALAuthenticationService_TEMP.swift`
2. Rename `MSALAuthenticationService_REAL.swift` back to `MSALAuthenticationService.swift`
3. Uncomment the `import MSAL` line
4. Build and test with real Microsoft authentication

## ðŸ“± Current Status:
- Mock authentication simulates Microsoft sign-in
- All app functionality works normally
- API calls use mock bearer tokens
- You can continue development and testing

Choose Option 1 to continue development immediately, or Option 2 if you want to fix the MSAL import first.
