# iOS Build Error Troubleshooting Guide

## Error: "Command SwiftCompile failed with a nonzero exit code"

This generic error can have several causes. Let's systematically troubleshoot:

## ðŸ”§ Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

### 1. Clean and Rebuild
```
1. In Xcode: Product â†’ Clean Build Folder (â‡§âŒ˜K)
2. Wait for completion
3. Product â†’ Build (âŒ˜B)
```

### 2. Check Build Log Details
```
1. In Xcode, open the Navigator panel
2. Click the "Report" tab (looks like a speech bubble)
3. Find the latest build attempt
4. Expand the SwiftCompile error to see specific details
5. Look for the actual error message (not just "nonzero exit code")
```

### 3. Common iOS Swift Compilation Issues

#### Missing Dependencies/Imports
- Make sure all Swift files have correct import statements
- Verify all referenced modules are available

#### Package Manager Issues
- File â†’ Packages â†’ Reset Package Caches
- File â†’ Packages â†’ Update to Latest Package Versions

#### Target Configuration Issues
- Check that all Swift files are added to the correct target
- Verify deployment target is compatible (iOS 14.0+ recommended)

#### Syntax/Type Errors
- Look for any red error indicators in Xcode
- Check for missing @Published, @StateObject, @ObservedObject annotations

### 4. iOS-Specific Checks

#### Info.plist Issues
- Verify Info.plist has required keys
- Check bundle identifier is valid

#### Signing Issues
- Verify code signing settings
- Check provisioning profiles

#### Architecture Issues
- Check if building for correct architecture (arm64 for devices, x86_64 for simulator)

### 5. Project-Specific Checks

#### MSAL Package Issues
Since we're using mock MSAL, ensure:
- No remaining `import MSAL` statements in any files
- All MSAL types are properly mocked
- No reference to real MSAL classes

#### SwiftUI Issues
- Check all @State, @Published, @ObservedObject are correctly used
- Verify all View protocol conformance
- Check binding syntax ($variable) is correct

## ðŸš€ Quick Fixes to Try

### Option 1: Reset Everything
```
1. Close Xcode
2. Delete derived data: ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/
3. Open Xcode
4. Clean Build Folder
5. Build again
```

### Option 2: Simplify to Test
```
1. Comment out complex views temporarily
2. Start with a simple "Hello World" app
3. Add components back one by one to identify the problematic file
```

### Option 3: Check Minimum Requirements
```
1. iOS Deployment Target: 14.0 or higher
2. Xcode Version: Recent version
3. Swift Version: 5.0+
```

## ðŸ“‹ Debugging Steps

1. **Get Specific Error**: Look at the build log for the actual Swift compiler error
2. **Isolate the Problem**: Try building individual files or comment out sections
3. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure all packages and frameworks are properly linked
4. **Verify Syntax**: Look for any SwiftUI or Swift syntax issues

## ðŸ’¡ Common Solutions

- **Missing @Published**: Add @Published to properties that need to trigger UI updates
- **Incorrect Binding**: Use $ syntax correctly for two-way bindings
- **Type Mismatches**: Ensure all types match between models and views
- **Missing Conformance**: Make sure all structs conform to required protocols (Codable, etc.)

## ðŸ†˜ If All Else Fails

Try creating a minimal test project with just:
1. Basic SwiftUI App structure
2. Simple ContentView
3. One model class
4. Build and run to verify Xcode setup
