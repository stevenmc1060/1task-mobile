# 🌐 Post-Authentication Network Error Fix

## ✅ Major Progress!
- ✅ **Authentication flow working** - you can sign in!
- ✅ **Redirect URI fixed** - no more AADSTS50011 errors
- ✅ **Bundle ID configured correctly** in Azure
- ✅ **Microsoft login web view launching successfully**

## ❌ Current Issue: Network Error After Sign-In

**What's happening:**
1. You tap "Sign in with Microsoft" ✅
2. Microsoft login page loads ✅  
3. You enter credentials successfully ✅
4. **Network error occurs during token exchange** ❌

This is a **token exchange network timeout** issue, not a basic connectivity problem.

## 🔧 Fix Applied: Retry Logic & Better Error Handling

I've updated the authentication service with:

### 🔄 **Automatic Retry**
- If network error (-50003 or -50004) occurs, automatically retry once
- 2-second delay between attempts
- Better success logging with account details

### 🔍 **Enhanced Error Detection**
- **-50003**: Network connection error
- **-50004**: Network timeout  
- **-50005**: Invalid server response
- Detailed console logging for debugging

### ⚙️ **Improved Configuration**
- Added `promptType = .selectAccount` for better auth flow
- Enhanced token exchange logging

## 🧪 Test Steps

1. **Clean and rebuild** the app:
   - Product → Clean Build Folder (⇧⌘K)
   - Build (⌘B)

2. **Try authentication again**:
   - Tap "Sign in with Microsoft"
   - Complete the login process
   - **If network error occurs, it will automatically retry once**

3. **Check Xcode debug console** for these new logs:
   ```
   🔄 Starting Microsoft sign-in (attempt 1/2)...
   ✅ Microsoft sign-in successful: user@example.com
      Account ID: abc123...
      Access Token received: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJ...
   ```

## 🌐 Network Environment Factors

### **Corporate/Restricted Networks**
If you're on a corporate or school network:
- **Firewall** may be blocking token exchange endpoints
- **Proxy settings** might interfere with HTTPS requests
- **SSL inspection** could cause certificate issues

### **Quick Test: Try Different Network**
1. **Switch to cellular data** (turn off Wi-Fi)
2. **Try authentication again**
3. If it works on cellular → network restriction issue

## 🔧 Additional Troubleshooting

### **Option A: Test on Physical Device**
- If using iOS Simulator, try on real iPhone
- Simulators sometimes have network limitations

### **Option B: Check Microsoft Endpoints**
Open Safari and test these URLs:
- `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token`
- `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me`

If these don't load, it's a network configuration issue.

### **Option C: Temporary Workaround**
If you want to continue development while fixing network issues, you can use the **"Continue as Demo User"** button to test the rest of the app functionality.

## 🎯 Expected Result

After the retry logic fix:
- **First attempt fails** → Automatic retry after 2 seconds
- **Second attempt succeeds** → Full authentication completion
- **Better error messages** if both attempts fail

The retry mechanism should resolve most temporary network hiccups during token exchange!

## 📋 Next Steps

Try the authentication flow again and let me know:
1. **Does the automatic retry work?**
2. **What do you see in the debug console?**
3. **Does switching to cellular data help?**

This should resolve the post-authentication network error! 🚀
